Prediction-using-unsupervised-ML:
In this project, we want to predict the scores of students given the study hours. I used a simple linear regression model using Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib and sklearn libraries since we have only 2 variables. Here are the 6 main steps for my work's structure : 1- I Imported necessary libraries and kept updating them throughout the project 2-I Prepared the data. 3-Split the data into training and test sets. 4-Trained the linear regression model. 5-Make predictions. 6-Evaluate the model, I used R-squared to evaluate my model, but other evaluation metrics can be used in regression.
